"""Agent system prompt assembly pipeline.

Structured prompt composition with:

1. **Static/dynamic section separation** — static sections (identity, rules, environment)
   are stable and cacheable; dynamic sections (skills metadata, engagement context) vary
   per invocation. A cache boundary marker separates them for Anthropic prompt caching.

2. **Tool prompt co-location** — tool prompts live with their tool code (e.g.,
   decepticon/tools/bash/prompt.py) and are injected here with role-specific variations.

3. **Cross-cutting patterns** — faithful reporting, verification gates, output discipline
   are injected consistently across all operational agents.

4. **Section registry** — prompts are composed from named sections, making it easy to
   add, remove, or reorder sections without touching the assembly logic.

Usage:
    # Simple (backward-compatible)
    load_prompt("recon", shared=["bash"])

    # Builder API (structured)
    prompt = (
        PromptBuilder("recon")
        .with_tool_prompts(["bash"])
        .with_shared(["language"])
        .build()
    )

<FAITHFUL_REPORTING>
Report findings exactly as observed. Do NOT:
- Speculate about vulnerabilities that scans did not confirm
- Inflate severity to appear more productive
- Omit negative results — "no findings" is a valid and valuable result
- Assume a service is vulnerable without evidence

If a tool returns empty output or no results, report that explicitly. The operator
needs ground truth to make decisions, not optimistic guesses. A false positive
wastes more time than a missed finding — the operator will direct further investigation.
</FAITHFUL_REPORTING>"""

_VERIFICATION_GATE = """\
<VERIFICATION_GATE>
Before declaring any finding CRITICAL or HIGH severity:
1. Verify with at least one additional method (different tool, manual confirmation, or secondary evidence)
2. Confirm the target is in scope (re-check roe.json if uncertain)
3. Document the evidence chain: what tool reported it, what confirmed it

Do NOT skip verification to save time. Unverified findings that turn out to be
false positives erode operator trust and waste downstream effort.
</VERIFICATION_GATE>"""

_OUTPUT_DISCIPLINE = """\
<OUTPUT_DISCIPLINE>
## Response Length Rules

- **Between tool calls**: Keep text to 1-2 sentences. State what you found and what you're doing next. No summaries, no analysis paragraphs — save those for the report.
- **Final report / handoff**: Be thorough and structured. Use the full format from RESPONSE_RULES.
- **When the operator asks a question**: Answer directly and concisely. Lead with the answer, not the reasoning.

Do NOT narrate your thought process ("Let me now check...", "I'll proceed to...").
Just execute. The operator can see your tool calls.

_FINDING_PROTOCOL_POINTER = """\
<FINDING_PROTOCOL>
Before recording findings, load the finding-protocol skill:
`load_skill("/skills/shared/finding-protocol/SKILL.md")`

naming conventions, and post-creation checklist. Load it before creating any

- **Challenge assumptions**: If the current approach isn't yielding results, say so and propose alternatives
