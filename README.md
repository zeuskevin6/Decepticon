## Install

**Prerequisites**: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and Docker Compose v2.
Supported on macOS (Apple Silicon + Intel), Linux (amd64 + arm64), and Windows (amd64 + arm64) — native via PowerShell or via WSL2 (Ubuntu / Kali).

**macOS / Linux / WSL2**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://decepticon.red/install | bash
decepticon onboard   # Interactive setup wizard (provider, API key, model profile)
decepticon           # Start the core stack and drop into the terminal CLI
```

The default start brings up the core management plane (LiteLLM, PostgreSQL, Neo4j, Skillogy, LangGraph, sandbox) and launches the terminal CLI. Specialist workloads (BloodHound CE, Sliver C2, Ghidra MCP, …) and the web dashboard come up on demand — the orchestrator spawns specialists via `ops_start("ad")` etc., and you bring up the dashboard from inside the CLI with `/web` (see [Web Dashboard](docs/web-dashboard.md)).

**Windows (PowerShell, native)**
```powershell
irm https://decepticon.red/install.ps1 | iex
decepticon onboard
decepticon
```

→ **[Quick start](docs/getting-started.md)** · **[Full setup walkthrough](docs/setup-guide.md)**

### Use as a library (pip)

Building on top of the agents — a product, a research integration, or a custom orchestrator? Install the SDK from PyPI:

```bash
pip install decepticon              # core SDK
pip install "decepticon[neo4j]"     # + the knowledge-graph attack-chain tools
```

`decepticon` is a **client SDK**: it ships the agent factories, middleware, tools, and skills, and routes LLM calls and sandbox execution to runtime services over HTTP (`DECEPTICON_LLM__PROXY_URL`, `SANDBOX_URL`). Running agents still needs those services — use the Docker stack above, or point the URLs at your own equivalents. See **[Decepticon as a library](docs/library-usage.md)** for the factory override surface, declarative `PluginBundle` plugins, and the safety gate.

## What is Decepticon?

The "AI + hacking" space is full of demos that run nmap and print a report. That's not what this is.

**Decepticon is a professional autonomous Red Team agent.** It executes realistic attack chains — reconnaissance, exploitation, privilege escalation, lateral movement, C2 — the way a real adversary would, not the way a scanner does.

But more importantly: it operates under the discipline that separates red teamers from script kiddies. Before a single packet leaves the wire, Decepticon generates a complete engagement package — **RoE**, **ConOps**, **Deconfliction Plan**, and **OPPLAN** with MITRE ATT&CK mapping — and every action runs inside those defined rules.

→ **[Engagement workflow deep dive](docs/engagement-workflow.md)**

---

## Why Decepticon?

**Real kill chains, not checkbox scans.** Decepticon reads an OPPLAN and pursues objectives through whatever path opens up — pivoting, adapting, chaining techniques.

**Interactive shells, actually.** Real offensive tools are interactive (`msfconsole`, `sliver-client`, `evil-winrm`). Decepticon runs every command inside persistent tmux sessions with automatic prompt detection — so when a tool drops into an interactive prompt, the agent sends follow-up commands without workarounds.

**Hardened sandbox isolation.** All commands run inside a Kali Linux sandbox on a dedicated operational network (`sandbox-net`), separate from the management plane (`decepticon-net`). LangGraph drives the sandbox via the Docker socket. → **[Architecture](docs/architecture.md)**

**Offense serves defense.** The planned [Offensive Vaccine](docs/offensive-vaccine.md) loop will turn findings into defense improvements through an attack → defend → verify cycle.

---

## Architecture

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/decepticon_infra.svg" alt="Decepticon Infrastructure" width="680">
</div>

Two-network design. The **always-on** management plane (LiteLLM, PostgreSQL, Skillogy, LangGraph) and the always-on sandbox plane stay up across the whole engagement; everything else is **dynamic-spawn** — the Web dashboard comes up on `/web` from the CLI, and specialist workloads (BloodHound CE, Sliver C2, Ghidra MCP, …) come up only when the orchestrator calls `ops_start(...)` (see [ADR-0006](docs/adr/0006-agent-driven-container-lifecycle.md)). Networks: management on `decepticon-net`; sandbox + C2 server + targets on `sandbox-net`. Neo4j is dual-homed so the agent (on management) can persist findings written from inside the sandbox.

→ **[Architecture deep dive](docs/architecture.md)** · **[Knowledge graph](docs/knowledge-graph.md)**

---

## Agents

16 specialist agents organized by kill chain phase, with a fresh context window per objective — no accumulated noise.

Orchestration · Reconnaissance · Exploitation · Post-Exploitation · Vulnerability Research · Domain Specialists (AD, Cloud, Smart Contracts, Reversing, Analyst).

→ **[Full agent roster and middleware stack](docs/agents.md)**

---

## Models & Providers

Tier-based, credentials-aware fallback chain. You declare which credentials you have in priority order; Decepticon builds the primary→fallback chain at every tier from there.

| Profile | Tier per agent | Use case |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| **eco** (default) | Per-agent (HIGH for orchestrator/exploiter/patcher/analyst, MID for execution, LOW for recon/soundwave) | Production |
| **max** | Every agent on HIGH | High-value targets |
| **test** | Every agent on LOW | Development / CI |

**Tier-mapped providers**: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, MiniMax, DeepSeek, xAI, Mistral, OpenRouter, Nvidia NIM, Ollama (local).
**Subscription OAuth**: Claude Max/Pro/Team, ChatGPT Pro/Plus/Team, Gemini Advanced, Copilot Pro, SuperGrok, Perplexity Pro.

Configure via `decepticon onboard`. → **[Full model reference & fallback examples](docs/models.md)**
