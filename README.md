## Install

**Prerequisites**: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and Docker Compose v2.
Supported on macOS (Apple Silicon + Intel), Linux (amd64 + arm64), and Windows via WSL2 (Ubuntu or Kali).
Native Windows is not supported — install WSL2 first, then run the commands below from inside the WSL shell.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://decepticon.red/install | bash
decepticon onboard   # Interactive setup wizard (provider, API key, model profile)
decepticon           # Start everything: terminal CLI + web dashboard at http://localhost:3000
```

→ **[Quick start](docs/getting-started.md)** · **[Full setup walkthrough](docs/setup-guide.md)**

## 💖 Support Decepticon

[![Sponsor](https://img.shields.io/badge/Sponsor-Decepticon-red?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://github.com/sponsors/PurpleCHOIms)

We're building Decepticon toward an **Offensive Vaccine** for the AI-driven threat landscape. If you believe in autonomous red teaming as a path to stronger defense, consider supporting the project.

## What is Decepticon?

The "AI + hacking" space is full of demos that run nmap and print a report. That's not what this is.

**Decepticon is a professional autonomous Red Team agent.** It executes realistic attack chains — reconnaissance, exploitation, privilege escalation, lateral movement, C2 — the way a real adversary would, not the way a scanner does.

But more importantly: it operates under the discipline that separates red teamers from script kiddies. Before a single packet leaves the wire, Decepticon generates a complete engagement package — **RoE**, **ConOps**, **Deconfliction Plan**, and **OPPLAN** with MITRE ATT&CK mapping — and every action runs inside those defined rules.

→ **[Engagement workflow deep dive](docs/engagement-workflow.md)**

---

## Why Decepticon?

**Real kill chains, not checkbox scans.** Decepticon reads an OPPLAN and pursues objectives through whatever path opens up — pivoting, adapting, chaining techniques.

**Interactive shells, actually.** Real offensive tools are interactive (`msfconsole`, `sliver-client`, `evil-winrm`). Decepticon runs every command inside persistent tmux sessions with automatic prompt detection — so when a tool drops into an interactive prompt, the agent sends follow-up commands without workarounds.

**Hardened sandbox isolation.** All commands run inside a Kali Linux sandbox on a dedicated operational network (`sandbox-net`), separate from the management plane (`decepticon-net`). LangGraph drives the sandbox via the Docker socket. → **[Architecture](docs/architecture.md)**

**Offense serves defense.** The planned [Offensive Vaccine](docs/offensive-vaccine.md) loop will turn findings into defense improvements through an attack → defend → verify cycle.

---

## Architecture

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/decepticon_infra.svg" alt="Decepticon Infrastructure" width="680">
</div>

Two-network design — management services (LiteLLM, PostgreSQL, LangGraph, Web) on `decepticon-net`; sandbox, C2 server, and targets on `sandbox-net`. Neo4j is dual-homed so the agent (on management) can persist findings written from inside the sandbox.

→ **[Architecture deep dive](docs/architecture.md)** · **[Knowledge graph](docs/knowledge-graph.md)**

---

## Agents

16 specialist agents organized by kill chain phase, with a fresh context window per objective — no accumulated noise.

Orchestration · Reconnaissance · Exploitation · Post-Exploitation · Vulnerability Research · Domain Specialists (AD, Cloud, Smart Contracts, Reversing, Analyst).

→ **[Full agent roster and middleware stack](docs/agents.md)**

---

## Models & Providers

Tier-based, credentials-aware fallback chain. You declare which credentials you have in priority order; Decepticon builds the primary→fallback chain at every tier from there.

| Profile | Tier per agent | Use case |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| **eco** (default) | Per-agent (HIGH for orchestrator/exploiter/patcher/analyst, MID for execution, LOW for recon/soundwave) | Production |
| **max** | Every agent on HIGH | High-value targets |
| **test** | Every agent on LOW | Development / CI |

**Tier-mapped providers**: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, MiniMax, DeepSeek, xAI, Mistral, OpenRouter, Nvidia NIM, Ollama (local).
**Subscription OAuth**: Claude Max/Pro/Team, ChatGPT Pro/Plus/Team, Gemini Advanced, Copilot Pro, SuperGrok, Perplexity Pro.

Configure via `decepticon onboard`. → **[Full model reference & fallback examples](docs/models.md)**
