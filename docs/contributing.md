Contributions are welcome — whether you're a security researcher, AI engineer, or someone who cares about making defense better through offense.

## Development Setup

**Prerequisites**: Docker, Docker Compose v2, and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (for Python tooling locally).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PurpleAILAB/Decepticon.git
cd Decepticon

# Copy and configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set at least one provider key, or set OLLAMA_API_BASE + OLLAMA_MODEL for local Ollama

# Start services with hot-reload (daily dev loop)
make dev

# Or run the full OSS UX (launcher → onboard → CLI) on local code
make dogfood
```

`make dev` uses `docker compose watch` — source changes sync into containers automatically without rebuilding. `make dogfood` is the release-shape verification path; see [makefile-reference.md](makefile-reference.md) for the full target list.

## Quality Gates

Before opening a PR, run the quality checks:

```bash
make quality         # Full gate: Python + CLI + Web (run before opening a PR)

make lint            # Python only: ruff check + ruff format --check + basedpyright
make lint-fix        # Auto-fix Python lint and formatting
make quality-cli     # CLI: typecheck + build + vitest
make web-lint        # Web dashboard ESLint

make test            # Python tests in Docker
make test-local      # Python tests locally (requires uv sync --dev)
```

Minimum Python version: **3.13**

## Adding an Agent

1. Create `decepticon/agents/{name}.py` with a `create_{name}_agent()` factory function
2. Follow the middleware stack pattern from an existing agent (e.g., `recon.py`)
3. Define the agent's skill sources in the `SkillsMiddleware` configuration
4. Register the agent in the orchestrator's dispatch table
5. Create a skills directory at `skills/{name}/` if the agent needs dedicated skills

---

## Adding a Skill

1. Create a directory: `skills/{category}/{skill-name}/`
2. Write `SKILL.md` following the [skill format](skills.md#skill-format)
3. Add `references/` for content over 100 lines
4. Add `scripts/` for automation the agent should execute
5. Restart — `SkillsMiddleware` discovers skills at agent boot

No registration required. Skills are discovered automatically from the agent's configured source paths.

---

## Testing

Python tests live in `decepticon/tests/`. Run inside Docker for a clean environment:

```bash
make test            # pytest in container
make test-local      # pytest locally (requires: uv sync --dev)
```

CLI tests run via `make quality-cli` (typecheck + build + vitest), or directly:

```bash
npm run test --workspace=@decepticon/cli
```

When adding a new agent or tool, add corresponding tests in `decepticon/tests/`.

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from `main`: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`
3. Make changes — keep commits focused and descriptive
4. Run `make quality` and ensure all checks pass
5. Open a Pull Request against `main`
6. In the PR description, include:
   - What changed and why
   - How to test the change
   - Any relevant MITRE ATT&CK technique IDs (for new agent capabilities or skills)
