"""Middleware slot enum and per-role applicability mapping.

The Decepticon agent factories assemble their middleware stack by
walking ``MiddlewareSlot`` in declaration order; each role declares
which slots apply via ``SLOTS_PER_ROLE``.

This module is the pure-data half of the original
``decepticon.agents.middleware_slots``. The langchain/deepagents-bound
default factories (``DEFAULT_SLOT_FACTORIES`` and the ``_make_*``
helpers) stay in the framework — keeping core langchain-free.

Plugin authors implementing custom middleware reach for
``MiddlewareSlot`` and the ``SAFETY_CRITICAL_SLOTS`` set when wiring
``PluginBundle.replaced_middleware`` / ``disabled_middleware``.

The gate is enforced by ``build_middleware`` in

overall contract (e.g. a replacement EngagementContextMiddleware still
needs to inject scope) — the gate exists so an accidentally-installed
plugin can't silently subvert the safety story.
