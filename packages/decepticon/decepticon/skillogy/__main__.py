"""``python -m decepticon.skillogy`` — run the Skillogy server.

Phase 1a (Amendment v0.2.2) boot sequence:

1. Build a ``Neo4jBackend`` against the configured Bolt URI (waits for
   the graph to be reachable; the compose ``depends_on: neo4j (healthy)``
   gating means it should already be up).
2. Seed the CI-built ``skills.cypher`` dump into Neo4j **only when the
   graph is empty** — a fresh/first-boot database self-heals, and a
   persistent one (a managed Neo4j, or a compose volume) is left
   untouched instead of re-MERGEing the whole corpus on every boot.
   Corpus changes (a new SKILL.md) are an out-of-band incremental
   ingest, not a boot concern.
3. Start the FastAPI REST app on ``$SKILLOGY_REST_PORT``.

Environment variables:
  SKILLOGY_REST_PORT          (default 9100)
  SKILLOGY_NEO4J_URI          (default ``bolt://neo4j:7687``)
  SKILLOGY_NEO4J_USER         (default ``neo4j``)
  SKILLOGY_NEO4J_PASSWORD     (default ``decepticon-graph``)
  SKILLOGY_NEO4J_DATABASE     (default ``neo4j``; managed backends e.g. Aura
                              name the database after the instance id)
  SKILLOGY_CYPHER_PATH        (default ``/app/skills.cypher`` — baked into the image)
  SKILLOGY_API_KEY            (optional Bearer-token auth for the protected endpoints)
