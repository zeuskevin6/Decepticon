# ICS / OT Operator Skill Catalog

Industrial engagements are not application security with longer rules of
engagement — they are a different discipline. A miswritten Modbus coil
on a real plant kills people. This catalog is **read-mostly by default**;
every write-scope skill carries an explicit safety gate.

## Hard rules

1. **No writes without OPPLAN.safety_critical confirmation**. The
   middleware refuses writes when the active OPPLAN objective does not
   carry `safety_critical_confirmed=true`. Bypass requires operator
   signature in `/workspace/safety-attestation.txt`.
2. **Read-only protocol discovery first**. Identify what's on the wire
   before any active probing. Many ICS protocols are unauthenticated;
   a single malformed read can crash an old PLC.
3. **Out-of-band physical safety**. The blue team includes plant ops.
   A ConOps with `blue_team.plant_ops_phone` is mandatory for engagements
   on active production lines.

## Playbooks

| Skill | Use for |
|---|---|
| `/skills/standard/ics/modbus-discovery/SKILL.md` | Read-only Modbus TCP/RTU enumeration, function code 3/4 polling |
| `/skills/standard/ics/modbus-write/SKILL.md` | **GATED** Write coils / registers; safety gate enforced |
| `/skills/standard/ics/bacnet-discovery/SKILL.md` | BACnet/IP Who-Is, object enumeration, device profile |
| `/skills/standard/ics/s7comm/SKILL.md` | Siemens S7 / S7Comm Plus enumeration via Snap7 / python-snap7 |
| `/skills/standard/ics/dnp3/SKILL.md` | DNP3 outstation / master discovery; integrity poll |
| `/skills/standard/ics/opcua/SKILL.md` | OPC-UA browse, anonymous auth check, certificate analysis |
| `/skills/standard/ics/hmi-web/SKILL.md` | HMI web stacks (Wonderware, Iconics, Schneider) — known CVEs |
| `/skills/standard/ics/engineering-software/SKILL.md` | TIA Portal / Studio 5000 / Unity Pro project extraction |

## Workflow

1. **Passive observation**: tap a SPAN port if available. Identify protocols
   on the wire (`tshark -Y modbus || tshark -Y bacnet || ...`).
2. **Network-layer discovery**: nmap with `-sV --script modbus-discover`,
   `bacnet-info`, `s7-info`, `dnp3-info` (NSE scripts ship in Kali by
   default; some are slow — set `-T2` for production networks).
3. **Function-code-3 polling**: read holding registers from every Modbus
   device discovered. Log register maps to the knowledge graph as
   `:Service` nodes with `protocol=modbus`.
4. **Identify the safety integrity level (SIL)** of any device touched.
   SIL 3+ devices NEVER get write probes without plant-ops sign-off.
5. **Engineering software attack path**: if you can reach the engineering
   workstation, extract the project archive (.s7p, .acd, .stp). The
   project file is the crown jewel — it reveals the entire process model.

## Detection gap

ICS networks rarely have host-based detection on PLCs/RTUs themselves —
the detection stack lives on the engineering workstation, the historian,
and any IT/OT gateway. Detector agent should generate Sigma rules
targeting:

- Function-code anomalies (write to coils outside normal ranges).
- Connection sources outside the documented MES/SCADA IP set.
- TIA Portal / Studio 5000 project download events.

## Out of scope by default

Active glitching of PLC firmware; firmware upload to PLCs; safety
controller writes — all of these require an explicit RoE annex signed
by the asset owner. The default ICS RoE template in `soundwave/` includes
this annex skeleton.
