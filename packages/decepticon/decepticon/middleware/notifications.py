"""Push background-job completion notices into the agent message stream.

When a tmux session's background command finishes, this middleware:

  1. Auto-fetches the diff that accumulated in the sandbox while the
     command was running — the agent no longer needs to call
     ``bash_output`` to pull it.
  2. Injects a HumanMessage tagged ``<system-reminder>`` carrying the
     completion summary AND the captured output, so the agent has
     everything it needs on its very next inference turn.
  3. Emits a ``background_complete`` custom stream event so the CLI can
     render a Claude-Code-style ``● Background command "..." completed
     (exit code N)`` line in the activity transcript, with the output
     attached to that single visual unit instead of being scattered
     across the message stream.

Hook: ``before_model`` — runs every turn, so completions land on the
very next inference even if the user did nothing between turns.

Cursor semantics
----------------
``sandbox.read_session_log_diff`` ADVANCES the per-session byte offset
each time it's called. Because this middleware reads the diff, a later
``bash_output(session=...)`` from the agent on the same session will
return no new bytes — that's intentional. ``bash_output`` is now a
fallback for explicit re-fetch (e.g. after the agent decides to
re-inspect a session it already saw), not the primary delivery path.
