"""AI-attack-surface classification for recon ingest (ADR-0007).

The ``llm-redteam`` plugin can attack an exposed Ollama / framework
endpoint, but recon historically had no way to *recognize* one — an open
``11434`` landed as a ``Service`` with ``service=unknown``. This maps the
port the scanner already saw to a typed ``Technology`` node so the plugin
and the chain planner can route on it.

Port detection is the cheapest, most deterministic signal; the header /
banner / title classifiers (separate ingest passes) corroborate it and
add provenance. Two confidence tiers:

  * ``dedicated=True``  — a single-purpose AI default port (Ollama's
    11434). Recorded as a first-class detection.
  * ``dedicated=False`` — AI-associated but shared with generic services
    (Gradio / Ray dashboards also host non-AI apps). Recorded with
    ``guess=True`` so it cannot, on its own, drive an exploit chain
    (ADR-0007 corroborating-only rule).

The catalog is intentionally conservative — only ports whose AI default
is well documented — to keep precision high; banner/header passes widen
recall.
