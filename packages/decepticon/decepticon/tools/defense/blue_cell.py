"""Blue Cell detection-coverage tool — the runtime that closes the loop.

The Offensive Vaccine pipeline documents a ``Defender`` that writes Sigma
rules, but nothing in the OSS ever ran those rules against the agent's own
activity (``docs/features/blue-cell.md``). ``blue_cell_scan`` is that missing
runtime: it replays the engagement's sandbox session logs through the shipped
:class:`~decepticon.blue_cell.tap.BlueCellTap` +
:class:`~decepticon.blue_cell.rule_match.RuleMatcher`, and records every rule
that fires as a ``DetectionFired`` node in the knowledge graph — linked
``-[:USES_RULE]->`` the ``DefenseAction`` (the rule artifact) and
``-[:DETECTED]->`` the offensive ``Finding`` / ``Technique`` it caught.

Recording is deterministic and idempotent (matching, not the LLM, decides
what fired), and detection timing is write-once so repeated scans never
inflate MTTD. The agent narrates the returned coverage summary — including
the **detection gaps** (Findings with no ``DETECTED`` edge) — into a Defense
Brief.
